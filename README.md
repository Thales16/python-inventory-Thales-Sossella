# Python Inventory Management System

This is my coursework assignment for the Python class. It is a simple command-line interface (CLI) tool to manage an inventory of products.

## How to run the program
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the command:
   python yourname_coursework1.py

## Features Implemented
- [x] Add items (Name, Category, Brand, Quantity, Price)
- [x] View all inventory
- [x] Update item quantity
- [x] Remove items by ID
- [x] Save and Load data from text file
- [x] Object Oriented Programming (Product class)
- [x] Error handling (Try/Except)

## Limitations
- The ID is generated randomly, so it might clash theoretically (though unlikely with small data).
- The file format is simple text (CSV style).
- Inputs must be precise (capitalization matters for categories sometimes).
